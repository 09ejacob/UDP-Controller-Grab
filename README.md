## UDP Command Sender & Listener for Grab Digital Twin

This module acts as a client that sends commands to and listens for data from the Grab digital Twin, a robot from Solwr, in Isaac Sim.

The robot simulation is managed in a separate repository: [Robot-World-Simulation-and-Digital-Twin](https://github.com/09ejacob/Robot-World-simulation-and-digital-twin)
